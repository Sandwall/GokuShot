# GokuShot

A joke screenshot program that helps you secretly embed a drip goku in your photos, written in C# .NET 5.

## Installation

Download either the self-contained or framework-dependent version of the app from the latest release, extract it to a folder of your choice, and run the executable.

## Usage
Once the program starts, two windows will appear.

The main window defines the capture area, and it can be resized to fit the user's needs. The smaller window contains Goku, and can be moved around even by dragging your mouse on Goku himself. Simply move and resize the window until you are satisfied with the position and scale, and use the controls in the main window in order to set his transparency & rotation to your liking. Once you're ready, hit the capture button in the top left, and the screenshot will appear on your Desktop folder, if you haven't changed it in the settings. Don't worry about the border around Goku showing up in the final screenshot, as it disappears whenever the capture button is pressed

**The screenshot above was taken with another instance of GokuShot, therefore there being another Goku positioned upside-down at the top of the image**

If the window with Goku in it becomes too small to drag around/resize properly, there is a button to reset his scale, which should also fix this.

If you click on the settings button next to the capture button, you have the option to change the path that the captures save to, as well as the name of the capture (a number will still be appended to it though).
